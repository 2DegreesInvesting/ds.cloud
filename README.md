The goal of this series is to help you get started with cloud computing.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

* Understand what cloud computing is and its benefits.
* Create a server with the tools you need.
* Run RStudio Server on the cloud.
* Scale up and down your computing resources.
* Access shared data on the cloud.
* Run a long process unattended.

## Who is the audience?

Anyone who might benefit from cloud computing, including organizations,
researchers, developers, and interns.

## Why is this important?

Although computing can make our work cheaper and more efficient, we
don't use it because we don't know it well enough.
