# Cloud computing

The goal of this series is to help you get started with cloud computing.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

-   Understand what cloud computing is and its benefits.
-   Create a server with the tools you need.
-   Run RStudio Server on the cloud.
-   Scale up and down your computing resources.
-   Access shared data on the cloud.
-   Run a long process unattended.

## Who is the audience?

Anyone who might benefit from cloud computing, including organizations,
researchers, developers, and interns.

## Why is this important?

Although computing can make our work cheaper and more efficient, we
don’t use it because we don’t know it well enough.

## Syllabus

### Introduction to cloud computing

This meetup introduces cloud computing.

Objectives:

-   Understand what cloud computing is and its benefits.
-   Create a server (droplet) on a cloud (DigitalOcean).
-   Explore your server from the console.
-   Run RStudio Server.

### Use cases

This meetup presents three use cases:

1.  Scale your computing resources up and down.
2.  Run RStudio with useful packages pre-installed.
3.  Run long processes unattended.
4.  Use case: Publish/access shiny apps.

### Manage data

Objectives:

-   Increase disk space to store more data.
-   Move data between a droplet and GitHub.
-   Move data between a container and GitHub.
-   Move data between a droplet and a container.
-   Move data between containers.
-   Move data between a droplet and your computer.

### Next (tentative)

-   Share data and other resources across users
