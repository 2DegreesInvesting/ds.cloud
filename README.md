# Cloud computing

The goal of this series is to help you get started with cloud computing.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

-   Understand what cloud computing is and its benefits.
-   Create a server with the tools you need.
-   Run RStudio Server on the cloud.
-   Scale up and down your computing resources.
-   Access shared data on the cloud.
-   Run a long process unattended.

## Who is the audience?

Anyone who might benefit from cloud computing, including organizations,
researchers, developers, and interns.

## Why is this important?

Although computing can make our work cheaper and more efficient, we
don’t use it because we don’t know it well enough.
