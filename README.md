The goal of this series is to help you understand and use cloud computing.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

* Understand what cloud computing is.
* Understand what are the benefits of cloud computing.
* Run RStudio on the cloud.
* Scale up/down your commuting resources.
* Access shared data on the cloud.
* Run a long process unattended.

## Who is the audience?

Anyone who might benefit from cloud computing, including organizations,
researchers, and developers -- at 2DII and beyond.

## Why is this important?

Although computing can make our work cheaper and more efficient, we
don't use it, largely because we don't know it well enough.

## Syllabus

### Introduction to cloud computing 

This meetup helps you understand what cloud computing is and some uses of it.

Objectives:

* Understand what cloud computing is and its benefits.
* Create a droplet (server) on DigitalOcean (a provider of cloud
services).
* Explore your droplet from the console.
* Run RStudio in a docker container running on the cloud.

### Next (tentative)

* Use case: Run RStudio with geospatial packages.
* Scale up/down your resources on the cloud.
* Use case: Run long processes unattended.
* Monitor process.
* Use case: Access private data, shared only within an organization.
* Use pins.
* Store and copy data from and to the cloud.
* Use case: Access private websites, shared only within an organization.
* Access/publish static websites.
* Access/publish shiny apps.
