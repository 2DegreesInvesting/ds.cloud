The goal of this series is to help you understand and use cloud computing.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

* Understand what cloud computing is.
* Understand what are the benefits of cloud computing.
* Choose, use, and customize your RStudio environment on the cloud.
* Scale up/down your commuting resources on the cloud.
* Run and monitor a long process unattended on the cloud.
* Access shared data on the cloud.
* Store and copy data from and to the cloud.

## Who is the audience?

Anyone who might benefit from cloud computing, including organizations,
researchers, and developers -- at 2DII and beyond.

## Why is this important?

> Despite the growing presence of cloud computing, its details remain obscure to
many. What exactly is the cloud, how does one use it, and what are its benefits
for [organizations], developers, researchers, ... and students?
